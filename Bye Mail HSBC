Hi,

Very heavy day it is. Last day of First Job. L

Leaving an organization like HSBC is not easy, especially
when you have such wonderful colleagues. It’s just a year and half for me here,
but I have earned some very good friends, guides, teachers and a lot of
talented peopleJ. I will surely miss
the release nights, team outing, celebration parties, fun time during breakfast
and lunch and many moments. It’s indeed a pleasure of mine to work here with
all of you. 

I usually speak a lot, but today’s not my day. I just want
to thank you. Thank you so much for sharing time with me. It’s a memory I will
never forget.

 

I would love to be connected. We will be in touch, on ( or WhatsApp (+91) 9712-936-995 or
Facebook/LinkedIn.   

Please have some chocolates@ my desk (D-15, Level P,
Business Bay).

 

See you soon.

Good ByeIJ
